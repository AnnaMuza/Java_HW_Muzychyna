   Duke   Leto Atreides of House Atreides,   ruler of the ocean planet Caladan, is assigned by the Padishah Emperor    Shaddam IV to serve as fief ruler of the planet Arrakis. Although   Arrakis is    a harsh and inhospitable    desert planet, it   is of enormous importance because it is the only planetary   source of melange, or the "spice",  a unique    and incredibly valuable substance   that extends human youth,   vitality and lifespan — the official reason     for its high demand in the Empire. It is also through the consumption of spice that the Guild navigators are able to navigate around the stars to   find paths to planetary or spatial targets.    Shaddam sees   House Atreides as a potential   future rival and threat, and conspires with House Harkonnen,     currently in charge of spice harvesting on Arrakis    and longstanding enemies of House Atreides, to destroy Leto and his family after their arrival.    Leto is aware his assignment is a trap of some kind,   but he must obey the Emperor’s orders.
